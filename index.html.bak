        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Howdy You!</p>
        <p>This is Nisheet Das. I'm from Chhindwara, a small town in Madhya Pradesh, surrounded by beautiful landscapes and a close-knit community. Growing up there instilled in me a strong sense of curiosity and determination, which has guided me throughout my journey.</p>
        
        <p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering from Delhi Technological University (DTU) (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering (DCE)), graduating with first-class distinction. During my time at DTU, I developed a deep interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems, which led me to pursue impactful research projects. My work resulted in two publications in IEEE journals focused on Deep Learning applications in power quality analysis and medical imaging.</p>
        
        <p>After graduation, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Cure.fit, a fitness tech startup, where I specialized in full-stack development. At Cure.fit, I contributed to building scalable web applications and enhancing user experiences for fitness enthusiasts across the country. This role allowed me to hone my technical skills while gaining valuable experience in a fast-paced startup environment. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), focusing on Machine Learning and Deep Learning to explore cutting-edge technologies and build expertise that bridges academia and industry.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work and studies, sports have always been a big part of my life. I represented the Madhya Pradesh Table Tennis Federation (MPTTF) in competitive table tennis and continue to enjoy playing badminton and football whenever I get the chance. As a lifelong FC Barcelona fan, watching their matches is something I never miss! Sports have taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilienceâ€”qualities that I strive to bring into all aspects of my life.</p>
