## Welcome!

I'm a **Backend focused Full Stack Engineer** with **5 years of zero-to-one engineering ownership**, currently pursuing my **Master's in Information Systems Management** with a specialization in **Software Engineering** at **Carnegie Mellon University** (graduating August 2025).

## Professional Background

I have extensive experience in **designing and scaling mission-critical services** for high-growth technology companies. During my 5-year tenure at **Cure.fit** (India's leading fitness tech unicorn), I led numerous initiatives that drove significant business impact:

- **10% revenue increase** through telesales platform integration
- **3.9% conversion rate improvement** via payment infrastructure optimization  
- **30% reduction in database load** through caching architecture implementation
- **80% reduction in development time** by deploying low-code solutions

## Technical Expertise

I specialize in **responsive designs**, **caching architectures**, and **cross-functional delivery** across product and engineering teams. My technical stack includes:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Node.js, Python, Java
- **Frontend**: React, React Native, Redux
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Tools**: Kafka, Datadog, JIRA, Git

## Current Focus

At Carnegie Mellon, I'm diving deep into **Machine Learning**, **AI Engineering**, **MLOps**, and **Distributed Systems**. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, exploring how ML can enhance traditional backend systems.

## Academic Projects

I've worked on several exciting projects including:
- **AI Sentiment Analysis Platform** in collaboration with Harley-Davidson
- **Movie Recommender System** with ML-powered recommendations
- **Goal Keeper (GoalLive)** - A smart scheduling application using Google Calendar API

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to discuss technology, share experiences, or explore collaboration opportunities. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:nisheetdas1@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nisheetdas1).
